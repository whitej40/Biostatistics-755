# Biostatistics 755
## Introduction to Longitudinal and Multilevel Modeling


## Overview

Longitudinal data consist of multiple measures over time on a sample of individuals. This type of data occurs extensively in both observational and experimental biomedical and public health studies, as well as in studies in sociology and applied economics. This course will provide an introduction to the principles and methods for the analysis of longitudinal data. Emphasis will be on data analysis, interpretation and case studies. Supporting statistical theory will be given at a level appropriate someone who has taken an introductory Biostatistics course (e.g., BIOS 757).  No calculus or linear algebra is required.  Problems will be motivated by applications in epidemiology and clinical medicine, health services research, and disease natural history studies.   

The main topics we will cover in this course (among others) are:

– Linear Models for Longitudinal data

– Linear Mixed Effects Models

– Generalized Estimating Equations

– Generalized Linear Mixed Models

– Multilevel Models

– Missing Data
